# 3rd-year-project
I was tasked with designing an in-shoe temperate monitoring device for patients with diabetes. The idea is, this device can be used to measure the temperature of the feet and from
this we can predict the occurence of diabetic foo ulcers and hence prevent it from occuring in advance.
